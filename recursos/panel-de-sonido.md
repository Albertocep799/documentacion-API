# Panel de sonido

Soundboard sounds are short audio clips that can be played in voice channels. There is a set of [default sounds](panel-de-sonido.md#get-default-soundboard-sounds) available to all users. Soundboard sounds can also be [created in a guild](panel-de-sonido.md#create-guild-soundboard-sound); users will be able to use them in the guild, and premium (Nitro) subscribers can use them in all guilds.

Custom soundboard sounds in a can be retrieved over the Gateway using Request Soundboard Sounds.

Soundboard sound limits are applied to the total amount of sounds in the guild, making them a lot simpler than emoji limits. The default sound limit is 8. The real limit depends on the guild's [premium tier](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352) and features.

These limits are summarized in the following table by premium tier. Note that if the guild has the MORE\_SOUNDBOARD feature, the applied limit is instead 96.
