Sticker limits are applied to the total amount of stickers in the guild, making them a lot simpler than emoji limits. The default sticker limit is 50.
The real limit depends on the guild's [premium tier](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352) and [features](/resources/guild#guild-features).

These limits are summarized in the following table by [premium tier](/resources/guild#premium-tier). Note that if the guild has the [`MORE_STICKERS` feature](/resources/guild#guild-features), the applied limit is always the tier 3 one (60).

| Premium Tier | Sticker Limit |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| `NONE`       | 5             |
| `TIER_1`     | 15            |
